# school_supplies_hub

After the end of the school year, all the students will be left with their old books and tools. Some of these might not be of any need in the future.  Especially when there is a change of stream, there will be many school supplies left with the students. If there is an arrangement to collect old books and other tools like geometry boxes, other students can use them.
